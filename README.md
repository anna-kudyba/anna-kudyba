# Where data meets storytelling. 🌟

Hi, I’m **Anna Kudyba**, and I simplify complex things through critical thinking, storytelling, and an analytical mindset. I worked in diverse fields, and I’ve built a truly multidisciplinary toolbox along the way with data as my focus. My approach is simple: learn, analyze, build, optimize and grow.

## About Me
- **Critical Thinker** – Whether it's optimizing processes or taking new challenges, I use innovative, data-driven solutions.
- **Multilingual Communicator** – Fluent in **German, English, and Polish**, I effectively connect with diverse audiences across industries.
- **Proven Results** – At a biotech startup, I saved **135,000 CHF annually** by optimizing procurement processes and renegotiating vendor contracts, a success that pushed me deeper interest in analytics.
- **Analytical and Technical** – With expertise in **SQL, Python**, and **data visualization**, I create dashboards, automate workflows, and discover valuie hidden in data.
- **Lifelong Learner** – Currently advancing my skills in **machine learning** and **AI** through EPFL’s program.

## What drives me
- Fighting **mis- and disinformation** with data analysis.
- Helping businesses **save smarter**, tell powerful stories, and find effective technical solutions.

Now, I’m excited to take on projects where I can use my technical skills, business know-how, and storytelling to make a difference and work with great people.
